<h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>
  The project is a Profile Page which shows my information.The loading animation is very simple and done with html,css and some basic javascript.Bootstrap has been used to make the site responsive and a beautiful navbar is added using Bootstrap. Font Awesome is used for all the icons added and the <strong>anchor</strong> tags have been designed specially they change color according to the company's profile color when hovered upon and all are properly labelled and have proper titles to them.The Instagram link in the footer section is must a see it has gradient over text upon hover.Codeforces Api was used to fetch my codeforces handle,rating and rank.
</p>
<h3>UNIQUE</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>All the anchor tags upon hover show their company's profile color.</li>
    <li>Instagram anchor tag has linear gradient</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Problems Faced</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The codeforces Api was a bit tricky to deal with</li>
    <li>Some problem in adding the loading animation</li>
    <li>JQuery was sent over http protocol which caused some issue while hosting on github</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>SCOPE OF IMROVEMENT</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The loading animation gets data from font awesome which takes a some time to get the icons so loading animaton is not very smooth</li>
    <li>The webpage is pretty decent but needs a lot of improvment and to be made a lot more attractive</li>
    <li>The page is responsive but needs to be more</li>
    <li>A lot of additional data from other competitive programming platforms need to be added</li>
    <li>BootStrap is extensively used causing a lot of designing problems</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Things Learned</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>A lot of css property learned</li>
    <li>BootStrap shouldn't be used a lot</li>
    <li>Some ES6 standards</li>
    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
</ul>
